# Image Based Attendance System Using ML
We want to provide a solution to replace the age old conventional methods which include roll-call and sign-up sheet attendance. This project is designed to help colleges/event organizers to capture attendees of class/event using facial recognition

Why would you want to change the attendance system?

* Time efficiency
* Labor Intensiveness
* Human Error
* Distraction

The project intends to create an AI Image recognition system to track the attendance of students/participants by analyzing facial features and marking their presence in the database. Below are few approaches planned, depending upon the research and technical parameters,one methodology will be finalized:

* Implementing Siamese Neural Network
* Performing Multi label multi class classification using Convolutional Neural Network
* Transfer learning using FaceNet+ Multi label multi class classification

# Use-cases:
* AI models can be utilized for capturing attendance of students by professors.
* Capturing attendance of participants for an event.

Example of a simple process flow which may take place in the project :

* Image Acquisition
* Face detection
* Attendance registration
* Attendance monitoring
